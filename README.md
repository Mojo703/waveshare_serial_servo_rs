# Waveshare Serial Servo

A 3rd party library to control waveshare's serial servos.

Developed with:

- Windows.
- [Bus Servo Adapter (A)](https://www.waveshare.com/catalog/product/view/id/5832/s/bus-servo-adapter-a) connected via USB.
- [ST3020 Servo](https://www.waveshare.com/product/st3020-servo.htm).
- 3S LiPo Battery (11.1V).

## Examples

The examples will list the avaliable serial ports, and request the user to select one. The correct port can be chosen by disconnecting the driver board, and running the example again, to see it's corresponding entry.

Each example can be run with a command like `cargo run --example ping`.
